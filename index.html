            <h3>How to prevent it ?</h3>
            <p>
                Millions of stray dogs live on the streets of India.Unfortunately, fear and ignorance have led many Indian citizens and officials to see street dogs as nothing but a nuisance and to seek eradication using inhumane methods such as poisoning and beating. But for every dog killed, another typically comes in to take over that dog's territory. The only scientific method to humanely reduce street dog populations is <u>mass spay and neuters</u>, commonly known as <u>animal birth control (ABC)</u>.
                Through ABC programs, all the dogs within a community or region are sterilized and then released back to their territories. The result: dog breeding stops and their population declines.

            <h3>Is stray pets are dangerous ?</h3>
            <p>A lot of vets and pet handlers believe that bringing up mongrels and strays is a lot easier than having an exotic pet at home, owing to their steel strong immune system and their ability to adapt to the Indian weather.You need to have your stray pets vaccinated of course, but apart from the regular medical care, love and attention, these pets hardly ever need anything unlike exotic pets who find it hard to handle the heat here. You are not just being cruel to your exotic pets but are also denying a beautiful home to a stray who could live with you much more easily.” Not just that, strays are equally intelligent and sensitive to their surroundings and so training them to look after your homes is also not a difficult task. The fact that strays are born in a competitive, dangerous and difficult environment and yet manage to survive says a lot about their adaptation qualities.</p>

            <h3>Be kind to Dog</h3>
            <p>“Animals have come to mean so much in our lives. We live in a fragmented and disconnected culture. Politics are ugly, religion is struggling, technology is stressful, and the economy is unfortunate. What’s one thing that we have in our lives that we can depend on? A dog or a cat loving us unconditionally, every day, very faithfully.” – Jon Katz</p>
